          text: `<p>Apple recently took a decision to move away from Intel chips to its own custom Apple processor.
                    These apple processors are based on the ARM designs which is already used in its iPhones and
                    iPads.</p>
                    <p>The reason apple is moving away from intel chips is because they claim that they produce the
                    most energy-efficient chips which consumes less power and provides greater performance. Apple
                    began to have dissatisfaction with Intel, as the innovation and improvement rate had decreased
                    immensely.</p>
                    <p>ARM the new generation chip, stands for Advanced RISC Machine, these chips are known for
                    low power consumption especially for phones, tablets and smart home devices. Apple announced
                    the new Mac would come out in late 2020 with these new ARM chips.</p>
                    <p>The question that everyone is intrigued about is if these Apple Silicon chips will be as powerful
                    as intel processors, and the answer is based on Surface Pro X with an ARM chips claiming it
                    offered 3 times the performance of the intel-based Surface Pro 6.</p>
                    So, yes these new generation ARM can be a revolutionary change for Apple.`,
